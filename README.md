# Autonomous_Landing_of_Quadcopter_darkflow
This is based on darkflow repository by thtrieu.

https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow

Actually this is a contribution to the original repository, by adding some python code and V-REP simulation files to simulate Quadcopter using Darknet Implemetation.
I honestly dont know how to cite the original user. Hence I just put this note
